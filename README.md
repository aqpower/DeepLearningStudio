# Jiiong 's DeepLearningStudio

## Overview
I am a student learning deep learning now, and this is what i do for learning deep learning.hope it make efforts for you.
DeepLearningStudio is a repository created to document and share various deep learning experiments and models.

and here is my favirite quote used on deep learning:
> *entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem*
> *如无必要，勿增实体*
